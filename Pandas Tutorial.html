                 ------------------------------ 

            ==> Pandas : is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, 
                          built on top of the python programming language. 

            
                # importing the pandas library :
                 --------------------------------

                   Series : A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type. 
                   DataFrame : A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.

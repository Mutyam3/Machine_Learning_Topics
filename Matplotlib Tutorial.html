                *** Matplotlib Tutorial *** 
                --------------------------- 

               Matplotlib is a popular library in python. 
               It was originally created by John D. Hunter in 2003 as a patch to IPython for 
               enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting via Gnuplot from the IPython command line. 
               Python was still in its early days, and Matplotlib was one of the first libraries to offer 
               robust capabilities for creating a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualization in Python. 
               It is particularly useful for those working in Python for data visualization and scientific computing.
               Over the years, Matplotlib has evolved into a powerful library capable of producing complex plots with 
               fine-tuned details. 

               The library is designed to be understandable for beginners but powerful enough for experts.
               Matplotlib allows for the creation for bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, error charts, power spectra, and much more, 
               with just a few lines of code. 

               To use Matplotlib, you first need to install it using pip if it's not already installed : 

               !pip install matplotlib 

               After installation, you import Matplotlib, typically its pyplot module, which provides a MATLAB-like interface. 
               The standard convention is to import it under the alias plt. 

               import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
                
               import numpy as np 

               ==> Creating and plotting a Linear Equation and a Quadratic Equation with Numpy and Matplotlib 

                    A Linear equation in two variables (say, x and y) can be represented as y = mx +c, where m is the slope of the line, and 
                    c is the y-intercept. 
                    Let's plot a simple linear equation using Matplotlib and NumPy. 

                1. Create an array for x values : Use Numpy to create an array of x values from which y values will be calculated. 

                      x = np.linespace(start = -10, stop = 10, num = 400)
                      print(x) # get the values from -10 to 10 with 400 numbers(values) => creates an array with 400 values 

                2. Define the linear Equation : Specify the slope(m) and intercept (c). 

                       m = 2 # Slope
                       c = 3 # Intercept 
                       y = mx + c

                3. Plot the equation : Use Matplotlib to plot the line. 

                           plt.plot(x,y, label = 'y=2x+3')
                           plt.title('Plot the linear Equation')
                           plt.xlabel('x')
                           plt.ylabel('y')
                           plt.xlim(0,10) # Lower Limit, Upper Limit 
                           plt.ylim(0,20) # Lower Limit, Upper Limit 
                           plt.grid(True) # background lo grinds vastai 
                           plt.legend( )
                           plt.savefig('Linear-equation.png')
                           plt.show()

                    In this Code : 

                         => np.linespace(start,stop,num) generates num evenly spaced samples, calculated over the interval[start,stop]
                         => plt.plot(x,y,label) plots y versus x as lines and / or markers with an optional label. 
                         => plt.title(),plt.xlabel(),and plt.ylabel() are used to add a title and labels to the axes.
                         => plt.grid(True) enables a grid to make reading the plot easier.
                         => plt.savefig() allows you to save the figure in various file formats such as PNG, JPEG,SVG,PDF and more.
                         => plt.show() displays the plot. 

                    This will produce a graph of the linear equation y = 2x + 3, showing a straight line that cuts through the y-axis at 3 
                    and has a slope of 2, rising two units in y for every increase of one unit in x. 

                    A Quadratic equation typically has the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b and c are constants. 

                    Here's how you can plot the quadratic equation y = x^2 - 4x + 4 : # a = 1 b = -4 c = 4.
                    
                    # Define the coefficients 

                    a = 1 
                    b = -4
                    c = 4

                    # Generate x values 

                     x = np.linespace(-1,7,400)

                    # Calculate y values using the quadratic equation 

                      y = a * x ** 2 + b * x + c 

                    # create the plot 

                      plt.plot(x,y, label = 'y= x^2 - 4x + 4')

                    # Adding title and labels 

                       plt.title('Plot of the Quadratic Equation')
                       plt.xlabel('x')
                       plt.ylabel('y')

                    # Add grid 
                       plt.grid(True)

                    # Show the plot 
                        plt.show()

                    
                 In this Script : 

                      => x = np.linspace(-1,7,400) generates 400 points between -1 and 7. The range is chosen to nicely show the 
                         shape of the curve, including the vertex of the parabola. 

                      => y = a * x ** 2 + b*X + c calculates the y-values based on the quadratic formula. 
                         plt.plot(x,y,label='..') plots the equation and includes a label. 

                      => plt.title(), plt.xlabel(), and plt.ylabel() set the title and labels of the axes. 

                      => plt.grid(True) adds a grid to the plot improve readability. 

                      => plt.show() displays the resulting plot. 

                  You can adjust the coefficients a,b,and c to expose different forms of quadratic curves.
